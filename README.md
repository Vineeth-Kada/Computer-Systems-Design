# CS2310 - Foundations of Computer Systems Design Lab
**Team:** Vineeth, Ravi, Goutam

Code Written for Foundations of Computer Systems Design Assignments under **Prof. Chandra Sekhar**, IITM.
In Lab 8 we implement a Hack CPU! Previous Labs have parts developed for it...
We used [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) for writing hdl code

**Index:**
* Lab1: Encoder, Decoder, Priority Encoder
* Lab2: Demultiplexer, Comparator, One Bit Error Detection, Multiplexer, Priority MUX
* Lab3: Carry Lookahead based adder(CLA) with and without Higher level terms, Ripple Carry Adder(RCA)
* Lab4: Signed and Unsigned Multiplier
* Lab5: Designed Interger unit.
    * Input: two 8 bit integers - X[8], Y[8], sPin(Signed/Unsigned), opCode
    * Output: Z = X{op}Y, OF = 1(if overflow), EQ = 1 (if X == Y)
* Lab6: Floating point multiplier
* Lab7: [Hack ALU](https://github.com/Vineeth-Kada/CS2310/blob/main/lab07/HackALU.hdl)
* Lab8: Hack CPU
